    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I scream you scream give me that icecream!</p>
    <p>Icecream is one of life's classics. Enjoy it in the summer for a cool sweet treat to beat the heat, enjoy it in the winter for some warmth for the soul.
        Either way icecream just scratches that itch that no other treat can! This recipe will take you through a classic and timeless way of making icecream.
        We used to make icecream in science class by shaking a bag of milk and sugar inside a bag of ice and salt. For some reason, that flavor is something we'll never forget!
        We want to share that joy with you!
